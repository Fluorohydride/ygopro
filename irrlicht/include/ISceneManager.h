	//! The Scene Manager manages scene nodes, mesh recources, cameras and all the other stuff.
	/** All Scene nodes can be created only here. There is a always growing
	list of scene nodes for lots of purposes: Indoor rendering scene nodes
	like the Octree (addOctreeSceneNode()) or the terrain renderer
	(addTerrainSceneNode()), different Camera scene nodes
	(addCameraSceneNode(), addCameraSceneNodeMaya()), scene nodes for Light
	(addLightSceneNode()), Billboards (addBillboardSceneNode()) and so on.
	A scene node is a node in the hierachical scene graph. Every scene node
	may have children, which are other scene nodes. Children move relative
	the their parents position. If the parent of a node is not visible, its
	children won't be visible, too. In this way, it is for example easily
	possible to attach a light to a moving car or to place a walking
	character on a moving platform on a moving ship.
	The SceneManager is also able to load 3d mesh files of different
	formats. Take a look at getMesh() to find out what formats are
	supported. If these formats are not enough, use
	addExternalMeshLoader() to add new formats to the engine.

		 *        using
		 *        SceneManager-&gt;getParameters()-&gt;setAttribute(COLLADA_CREATE_SCENE_INSTANCES, true);
		 *        Created scene nodes will be named as the names of the

		//! Adds a terrain scene node to the scene graph.
		/** This node implements is a simple terrain renderer which uses
		a technique known as geo mip mapping
		for reducing the detail of triangle blocks which are far away.
		The code for the TerrainSceneNode is based on the terrain
		renderer by Soconne and the GeoMipMapSceneNode developed by
		Spintz. They made their code available for Irrlicht and allowed
		it to be distributed under this licence. I only modified some
		parts. A lot of thanks go to them.

		This scene node is capable of loading terrains and updating
		the indices at runtime to enable viewing very large terrains
		very quickly. It uses a CLOD (Continuous Level of Detail)
		algorithm which updates the indices for each patch based on
		a LOD (Level of Detail) which is determined based on a patch's
		distance from the camera.

		The patch size of the terrain must always be a size of 2^N+1,
		i.e. 8+1(9), 16+1(17), etc.
		The MaxLOD available is directly dependent on the patch size
		of the terrain. LOD 0 contains all of the indices to draw all
		the triangles at the max detail for a patch. As each LOD goes
		up by 1 the step taken, in generating indices increases by
		-2^LOD, so for LOD 1, the step taken is 2, for LOD 2, the step
		taken is 4, LOD 3 - 8, etc. The step can be no larger than
		the size of the patch, so having a LOD of 8, with a patch size
		of 17, is asking the algoritm to generate indices every 2^8 (
		256 ) vertices, which is not possible with a patch size of 17.
		The maximum LOD for a patch size of 17 is 2^4 ( 16 ). So,
		with a MaxLOD of 5, you'll have LOD 0 ( full detail ), LOD 1 (
		every 2 vertices ), LOD 2 ( every 4 vertices ), LOD 3 ( every
		8 vertices ) and LOD 4 ( every 16 vertices ).
		\param heightMapFileName: The name of the file on disk, to read vertex data from. This should
		be a gray scale bitmap.
		\param parent: Parent of the scene node. Can be 0 if no parent.
		\param id: Id of the node. This id can be used to identify the scene node.
		\param position: The absolute position of this node.
		\param rotation: The absolute rotation of this node. ( NOT YET IMPLEMENTED )
		\param scale: The scale factor for the terrain. If you're

		core::vector ( 100.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f ). If you use a Y
		scaling factor of 0.0f, then your terrain will be flat.
