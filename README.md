# EDOPro

EDOPro is the bleeding-edge fork of the YGOPro core, an automated scripting engine for the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game. It comes with a sample GUI.

Due to core updates to accommodate new cards and features, it is incompatible with current stable builds like Percy.

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/edo9300/ygopro/wiki/Building-EDOPro) for build instructions and a user manual.
